# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Nanosh is a backend server for a digital board game. Originally built with TypeScript on Bun runtime, the project is transitioning to Go with Nakama game server for improved performance and multiplayer capabilities. The project uses Redis for database operations.

## Development Commands

### TypeScript/Bun Commands (Legacy)
```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run a specific test file
bun test path/to/file.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
bun test --grep "pattern"

# Run TypeScript compiler check
bunx tsc --noEmit
```

### Go/Nakama Commands (Current)
```bash
# Run Go tests from src/nakama directory
cd src/nakama && go test ./gamelogic/...

# Run specific test package
cd src/nakama && go test ./gamelogic/calculator/expedition/init/loot -v

# Run tests with specific pattern
cd src/nakama && go test ./gamelogic/... -run TestName -v

# Build Nakama module
cd src/nakama && go build -buildmode=plugin -o ./modules/nanosh.so
```

### Dependencies
```bash
# TypeScript/Bun dependencies
bun install
bun add package-name
bun add -d package-name

# Go dependencies (managed via go.mod)
go mod tidy
go mod download
```

## Architecture

### TypeScript to Go/Nakama Transition

The project is migrating from TypeScript to Go with Nakama for better performance and native multiplayer support:

#### TypeScript Structure (Legacy - `src/`)
- **Location**: `src/calculator/`, `src/types/`, `src/utils/`
- **Pattern**: Functional approach with immutable state updates
- **Testing**: Bun test runner with `.test.ts` files

#### Go/Nakama Structure (Current - `src/nakama/`)
- **Location**: `src/nakama/gamelogic/`
  - `calculator/` - Game actions and logic (mirrors TS structure)
  - `types/` - Go structs for game entities
  - `utils/` - Utility functions (random, dice, wounds, etc.)
  - `errors/` - Custom error definitions
- **Pattern**: Similar functional approach, adapted for Go
- **Testing**: Go's built-in testing with `_test.go` files
- **Module**: `nanosh/nakama-modules/gamelogic` package structure

### Core Structure
- **Game State Management**:
  - TypeScript: `src/types/game.ts` with `Game` interface
  - Go: `src/nakama/gamelogic/types/game.go` with `Game` struct
- **Action System**:
  - TypeScript: `src/calculator/actions/room/action.ts`
  - Go: `src/nakama/gamelogic/calculator/actions/room/action.go`
- **Type Safety**:
  - TypeScript: Interfaces in `src/types/`
  - Go: Structs in `src/nakama/gamelogic/types/`

### Key Patterns
- **Action Functions**:
  - TypeScript: Returns `[newState | null, error | null]` tuple
  - Go: Returns `(*types.Game, error)` - cleaner Go idiom
- **State Immutability**: Both versions create new state rather than mutating
- **Test Structure**:
  - TypeScript: `.test.ts` files using Bun
  - Go: `_test.go` files using Go testing package
- **Path Aliases**:
  - TypeScript: `@nanosh/*` alias
  - Go: Standard Go import paths `nanosh/nakama-modules/gamelogic/...`
- **Deterministic Random Generation**:
  - TypeScript: `seedrandom(\`${gameID}-${invokeTime}\`)`
  - Go: `random.CreateSeededPRNG(gameID, invokeTime, username)` with SHA256 hashing
- **Error Handling**:
  - TypeScript: Tuple return with error as second element
  - Go: Standard Go error as second return value

### Database
- Redis connection is configured in `src/database/redis.ts`
- Default connection: `redis://localhost:6379`

### Game Mechanics
- **Characters**: Managed via a Map with character names as keys
- **Sectors**: Hierarchical structure with Supersectors containing Subsectors
- **Actions**: Consume Action Points (AP) and may require specific conditions
- **Cycles**: Game progresses through day/cycle system

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual actions using mock game states
- Tests verify both success cases and error conditions
- Initial game state generator available at `src/utils/initialState/game.ts`

## ESLint Configuration
- Uses `@typescript-eslint` parser and plugin
- Enforces removal of unused imports
- Variables/args prefixed with `_` are ignored for unused checks

## Implementation Status & Documentation

### Known Implementation Challenges & Performance Considerations

#### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues
1. **Deep Cloning Overhead**: Every action clones entire game state via `structuredClone(state)`
2. **State Validation**: No runtime validation of game state integrity
3. **Redis Serialization**: Large game states may hit memory limits

#### ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Issues
1. **O(n) Operations**: Linear searches through collections, no indexing
2. **State Size Growth**: Modifiers accumulate without cleanup for expired entries
3. **Tight Coupling**: Actions directly manipulate state structure

#### ðŸŸ¢ Architectural Strengths
- Excellent test coverage (450+ tests passing across TypeScript and Go)
- Consistent error handling patterns (`[newState | null, error | null]` in TS, `(*Game, error)` in Go)
- Strong type safety (TypeScript interfaces + Go structs)
- Deterministic testing with fixed seeds
- Immutable state updates prevent accidental mutations
- Comprehensive expedition system with 43+ cards across 5 categories

### Performance Optimization Recommendations

#### High Priority
1. **Implement incremental state updates** instead of full cloning
2. **Add state validation schemas** to prevent invalid game states  
3. **Add bounds checking** for resources and inventory limits

#### Medium Priority
1. **Optimize frequent lookup operations** with indexing
2. **Standardize error handling** patterns across all modules
3. **Add input validation** for security and robustness

#### Low Priority
1. **Refactor to Command Pattern** for better action encapsulation
2. **Add state compression** for Redis storage optimization
3. **Implement connection pooling** for Redis operations

### Code Quality Standards
- All new actions must include corresponding `.test.ts` files
- Follow existing patterns for state mutation and error handling
- Use path aliases (`@nanosh/*`) for all imports
- Maintain deterministic test behavior with fixed seeds
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Memory Log
- LibPo is Liberation point
- When reading docs, ignore "Back to Phases" or similar phrases because it's just a link to another header

## Go/Nakama Migration Notes

### Conversion Guidelines
1. **File Structure**: Mirror TypeScript structure in Go (e.g., `calculator/actions/` â†’ `calculator/actions/`)
2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Go files: snake_case.go (e.g., `hazardous_terrain.go`)
   - Go functions: PascalCase for exported (e.g., `HazardousTerrain`)
   - Go tests: function_test.go pattern
3. **State Management**:
   - TypeScript: Clone entire state with `structuredClone()`
   - Go: Still cloning for now, but more efficient patterns available
4. **Random Generation**:
   - Always use `random.CreateSeededPRNG()` with gameID, invokeTime, username
   - Use `random.GetRandomString()` for IDs
   - Use `dice.RollRange()` for random ranges
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Define custom errors in `errors/` package
   - Return early on errors (Go idiom)
6. **Testing**:
   - Table-driven tests preferred in Go
   - Use subtests with `t.Run()`
   - Always test deterministic behavior with same seeds
